# Packet 0x3

Packet corresponds to this client function call:

```
/**
 *	This function is called when the server indicates that an entity has entered
 *	the player's AoI.
 *
 *	It is complicated because it may be called out of order.
 *
 *	@param	id			entity id.
 *	@param	spaceID		id of space where to create the entity in.
 *	@param	vehicleID	id of an entity to use as vehicle.
 *
 */
void EntityManager::onEntityEnter( EntityID id,
	SpaceID spaceID, EntityID vehicleID )
```

And here how it looks like:

```
struct EntityLeave {
    int32 entityID;
    int32 spaceID;
    int32 vehicleID;
}
```
