# Packet 0x5

Packet 0x5 corresponds to this client function call:

```
/**
 *	This function is called when the server provides us with the details
 *	necessary to create an entity here. The minimum data it could send
 *	is the type of the entity, but for the moment it sends everything.
 *
 *	@param	id			entity id.
 *	@param	type		entity type id.
 *	@param	spaceID		id of space where to create the entity in.
 *	@param	vehicleID	id of an entity to use as vehicle.
 *	@param	position	position of entity.
 *	@param	yaw			yaw of entity.
 *	@param	pitch		pitch of entity.
 *	@param	roll		roll of entity.
 *	@param	data		entity's data.
 */
void EntityManager::onEntityCreate( EntityID id, EntityTypeID type,
	SpaceID spaceID, EntityID vehicleID, const Position3D & position,
	float yaw, float pitch, float roll,
	BinaryIStream & data )
```

And here how it looks like:

```
struct Entity {
    int32 entityID;
    int16 type;
    int32 spaceId;
    int32 vehicleId;
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 direction;
    int32 _sizeState;

    void* state; // sizeof(_sizeState)
}
```


Looks like all params are clear beside these two:
* type - in fact, it is index of python class stored in entities.xml
* data - really strange thing... I've tried to understood how data is stored, but have no luck. I guess it is a strange form of PyDict.
