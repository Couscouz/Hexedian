# Packet 0x8

Packet corresponds to this client function call:

```
/**
 *	This method is called when we receive a script method call message
 *	for one of our client-side entities from the server.
 *
 *	@param	id				entity id.
 *	@param	messageID		message id.
 *	@param	data			message data.
 */
void EntityManager::onEntityMethod( EntityID id, int messageID,
	BinaryIStream & data )
```

And here how it looks like:

```
struct EntityMethod {
    int32 entityID;
    int32 messageID;
    BinaryIStream & data;
}
```

Looks like messageId is generated during build and I have no idea how to get it automatically for each new patch.
