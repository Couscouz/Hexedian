# Packet 0x4

Packet corresponds to this client function call:

```
/**
 *	This function is called when the server indicates that an entity has left
 *	the player's AoI. It is complicated because it may be called out of order.
 *
 *	@param	id				entity id.
 *	@param	cacheStamps		Unused parameter.
 */
void EntityManager::onEntityLeave( EntityID id, const CacheStamps & cacheStamps )
```

And here how it looks like:

```
struct EntityLeave {
    int32 entityID;
}
```
